Uses
Face recognition logging.
Swcurity cams hooked to IoT, 
This instance of hash blocktable is named facehash
join facehash to different log blocktable named facelog on hashid
Facelog has gps and timestamp columns, and fk to facehash

End user scenario.
A pawnshop gets robbed,
alrrady has security system cameras
Wants to find crooks whobrobbed him
Police know crooks too, but they are interstate freeway bandits
Police cant find then and get multiple cases a year.

Pawnshop buys and installs public blockchain face logger 
A box hooked to a face camera by their door
As every customer leaves the store, 
Local pc software takes the camera image, calulculates a small output
And logs it with time and date and store gps into public blockchain tables
10 or 100 stores around the world do the same

If a robbery does happen again, or whenever any store wants to search the blockchain
They can take anybface from their camera and search facehash
If theyvget some face hits there, they can search the logs of other stores around the world
Hash, time, and gps only though.
To confirm a face outside their store, 
theyd have to find aContact info for another store from gps
Thrn call and check if camera logs near thatbtime are available

Other uses are security companies, banks, and police
Thry already have systems and budgets
This is for the public domain to use like a gas station owner or pawnshop or small jewelry store.
